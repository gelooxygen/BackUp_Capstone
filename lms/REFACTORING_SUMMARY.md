# Laravel LMS Refactoring Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive refactoring of the Laravel LMS project to add a new "Principal" user role and implement role-based access control improvements.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Principal Role Implementation

#### User Model Updates (`app/Models/User.php`)
- Added `ROLE_PRINCIPAL` constant
- Principal role has access to User Management, Calendar Management, and Communication features

#### Database Migration (`database/migrations/2025_01_21_000000_add_principal_role_to_database.php`)
- Created migration to add Principal role to the database
- Uses Spatie Laravel-Permission package for role management

#### Database Seeder (`database/seeders/PrincipalUserSeeder.php`)
- Created seeder to add a test Principal user
- Test credentials: `principal@example.com` / `password`

### 2. Dashboard System Refactoring

#### Main Dashboard (`resources/views/dashboard.blade.php`)
- Updated to include Principal role check
- Now loads appropriate dashboard partial based on user role

#### Principal Dashboard Partial (`resources/views/partials/principal_dashboard.blade.php`)
- **User Management Section**: View users, students, teachers, departments
- **Calendar Management Section**: Manage events, schedules, view events list
- **Communication Section**: Announcements, messages, notifications
- **Statistics Overview**: Basic counts (students, teachers, subjects, attendance)
- **Recent Activities**: Recent enrollments and announcements
- **Quick Actions**: Fast access to common tasks

#### Admin Dashboard Updates (`resources/views/partials/admin_dashboard.blade.php`)
- Added **Enrollment Management Section** with:
  - Create User (Student/Teacher/Parent)
  - View Enrollments
  - Add Student
  - Add Teacher
- Hidden analytics and reports sections from Principal users using `@if(auth()->user()->role_name === 'Admin')` conditions

### 3. Public Registration Removal

#### Routes (`routes/web.php`)
- Commented out public registration routes
- Registration now only available to Admin users via dashboard

#### Registration Controller (`app/Http/Controllers/Auth/RegisterController.php`)
- Routes disabled but controller remains for potential future use

### 4. New Enrollment Management System

#### Enrollment Controller (`app/Http/Controllers/EnrollmentController.php`)
- **Admin-only access** with `middleware(['auth', 'role:Admin'])`
- **User Creation**: Can create Student, Teacher, or Parent users
- **Profile Creation**: Automatically creates role-specific profiles (Student/Teacher)
- **Enrollment Management**: Optional enrollment creation during user creation
- **Validation**: Comprehensive form validation for all user types

#### Enrollment Views
- **Create View** (`resources/views/enrollments/create.blade.php`):
  - Dynamic form fields based on selected role
  - Student-specific fields: admission ID, gender, parent email, year level
  - Teacher-specific fields: teacher ID, specialization
  - Optional enrollment information
  - JavaScript to show/hide relevant fields
- **Index View** (`resources/views/enrollments/index.blade.php`):
  - List all enrollments with pagination
  - User-friendly display with avatars and status badges
  - Actions: view, edit, delete

### 5. Route Protection and Access Control

#### Role-Based Middleware Updates
- **User Management**: Admin and Principal can view, Principal can edit but not delete
- **Student Management**: Admin and Principal can view/edit, only Admin can add/delete
- **Teacher Management**: Admin and Principal can view/edit, only Admin can add/delete
- **Department/Subject Management**: Admin and Principal can view/edit, only Admin can add/delete
- **Calendar Management**: Admin, Principal, and Teacher access
- **Communication**: All authenticated users (Admin, Principal, Teacher, Student, Parent)

#### Specific Route Restrictions
- **Delete Operations**: Restricted to Admin only
- **Add Operations**: Restricted to Admin only
- **View/Edit Operations**: Available to Admin and Principal
- **Calendar Events**: Admin, Principal, and Teacher can manage

### 6. HomeController Updates (`app/Http/Controllers/HomeController.php`)

#### Dashboard Data Loading
- Added `loadPrincipalData()` method
- Principal dashboard shows same statistics as Admin but without sensitive analytics
- Reuses existing data loading logic for consistency

#### Role-Based Data Loading
- Admin: Full analytics, reports, and management data
- Principal: User management, calendar, and communication data
- Teacher: Teaching-specific data
- Student: Academic data
- Parent: Child-related data

## Security Features

### Role-Based Access Control
- Uses Laravel's built-in middleware system
- Spatie Laravel-Permission package for advanced role management
- Route-level protection for sensitive operations

### Data Isolation
- Principal users cannot access:
  - Advanced analytics and reports
  - System configuration
  - User deletion
  - Sensitive administrative functions

### Audit Trail
- All user creation and enrollment activities are logged
- Activity logging maintained for compliance

## Testing

### Test Users Created
1. **Principal User**:
   - Email: `principal@example.com`
   - Password: `password`
   - Role: Principal
   - Access: User Management, Calendar, Communication

2. **Admin User** (existing):
   - Full system access
   - Can create new users
   - Access to all features including analytics

### Testing Scenarios
1. **Principal Login**: Should see Principal dashboard with limited features
2. **Admin Login**: Should see full Admin dashboard with Enrollment Management
3. **Role Switching**: Dashboard automatically adapts based on user role
4. **Access Control**: Principal cannot access Admin-only features
