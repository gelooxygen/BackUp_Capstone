    Route::get('grade-entry', 'gradeEntryForm')->name('grading.grade-entry');
    Route::post('store-grades', 'storeGrades')->name('grading.store-grades');
    
    // GPA and Ranking
    Route::get('gpa-ranking', 'gpaRanking')->name('grading.gpa-ranking');
    
    // Performance Analytics
    Route::get('performance-analytics', 'performanceAnalytics')->name('grading.performance-analytics');
    
    // Weight Settings
    Route::get('weight-settings', 'weightSettings')->name('grading.weight-settings');
    Route::post('store-weight-settings', 'storeWeightSettings')->name('grading.store-weight-settings');
    
    // Grade Alerts
    Route::get('grade-alerts', 'gradeAlerts')->name('grading.grade-alerts');
    Route::post('resolve-alert/{alert}', 'resolveAlert')->name('grading.resolve-alert');
    
    // Export Routes
    Route::get('export-grades', 'exportGrades')->name('grading.export-grades');
    Route::get('export-gpa', 'exportGpa')->name('grading.export-gpa');
});
```

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Run Migrations

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### 2. Seed Sample Data (Optional)

```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=GradingSeeder
```

### 3. Add Menu Items

The menu items are automatically added via migration, but you can manually add them to your navigation if needed.

### 4. Configure Dependencies

Ensure the following packages are installed:

```bash
composer require maatwebsite/excel
composer require barryvdh/laravel-dompdf
```

## Usage Guide

## Configuration

### Grading Thresholds

Default thresholds can be modified in the `GradingController`:

```php
private function checkGradeAlerts($subjectId, $academicYearId, $semesterId)
{
    $lowGradeThreshold = 75; // Modify this value
    // ... rest of the method
}
```

### GPA Scale

The GPA calculation uses a 4.0 scale. Modify the `percentageToGradePoints` method in `GradingController` to change the scale:

```php
private function percentageToGradePoints($percentage)
{
    if ($percentage >= 90) return 4.0;
    if ($percentage >= 85) return 3.7;
    // ... modify as needed
}
```

## API Endpoints

The module provides several API endpoints for integration:

- `GET /grading/gpa-ranking` - Get GPA rankings
- `GET /grading/performance-analytics` - Get performance data
- `GET /grading/grade-alerts` - Get active alerts
- `POST /grading/store-grades` - Store grades
- `POST /grading/store-weight-settings` - Store weight settings

## Security

- All routes are protected by authentication middleware
- Role-based access control can be implemented
- Input validation for all grade entries
- SQL injection protection through Eloquent ORM

## Performance Considerations

- GPA calculations are cached in the database
- Bulk operations use database transactions
- Charts use client-side rendering for better performance
- Pagination implemented for large datasets

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Grades not saving**
   - Check database permissions
   - Verify form validation rules
   - Check for JavaScript errors

2. **GPA not calculating**
   - Ensure grades have valid percentages
   - Check academic year and semester settings
   - Verify weight settings are configured

3. **Export not working**
   - Ensure Excel/PDF packages are installed
   - Check file permissions
   - Verify route configuration

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode in `.env` to see detailed error messages:

```env
APP_DEBUG=true
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Predictive performance modeling
   - Learning outcome tracking
   - Competency-based assessment

2. **Integration Features**
   - Parent portal integration
   - SMS/Email notifications
   - Third-party LMS integration

3. **Mobile Support**
